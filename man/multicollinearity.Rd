\title{
Decision Rule to Detect Troubling Multicollinearity
}
\description{
Given a multiple linear regression model with n observations and k independent variables, 
the degree of near-multicollinearity affects its statistical analysis (with a level of significance 
of alpha\%) if there is a variable i, with i = 1,...,k, that verifies that the null hypothesis is not 
rejected in the original model and is rejected in the orthogonal model of reference.
}
\usage{
multicollinearity(y, x, alpha = 0.05)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{y}{A numerical vector representing the dependent variable of the model.}
  \item{x}{A numerical design matrix that should contain more than one regressor (intercept included in the first column).}
  \item{alpha}{Significance level (by default, 5\%).}
}
\details{
This function compares the individual inference of the original model with that of the orthonormal model taken as reference. 

Thus, if the null hypothesis is rejected in the individual significance tests in the model where there are no linear 
relationships between the independent variables (orthonormal) and is not rejected in the original model, the reason 
for the non-rejection is due to the existing linear relationships between the independent variables (multicollinearity) 
in the original model.

The second model is obtained from the first model by performing a QR decomposition, which eliminates the initial 
linear relationships.
}
\value{
The function returns the value of the RVIF and the established thresholds, as well as indicating whether or not the individual
significance analysis is affected by multicollinearity at the chosen significance level.

\examples{
### Example 1
	
  set.seed(2024)
  obs = 100
  cte = rep(1, obs)
  x2 = rnorm(obs, 5, 0.01)  # related to intercept: non essential
  x3 = rnorm(obs, 5, 10)
  x4 = x3 + rnorm(obs, 5, 0.5) # related to x3: essential
  x5 = rnorm(obs, -1, 3)
  x6 = rnorm(obs, 15, 0.5)
  y = 4 + 5*x2 - 9*x3 -2*x4 + 2*x5 + 7*x6 + rnorm(obs, 0, 2)
  x = cbind(cte, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6)
  multicollinearity(y, x)

### Example 2
### Effect of sample size
  
  obs = 25 # by decreasing the number of observations affected to x4 
  cte = rep(1, obs)
  x2 = rnorm(obs, 5, 0.01)  # related to intercept: non essential
  x3 = rnorm(obs, 5, 10)
  x4 = x3 + rnorm(obs, 5, 0.5) # related to x3: essential
  x5 = rnorm(obs, -1, 3)
  x6 = rnorm(obs, 15, 0.5)
  y = 4 + 5*x2 - 9*x3 -2*x4 + 2*x5 + 7*x6 + rnorm(obs, 0, 2)
  x = cbind(cte, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6)
  multicollinearity(y, x)

### Example 3
  
  y = 4 - 9*x3 - 2*x5 + rnorm(obs, 0, 2)
  x = cbind(cte, x3, x5) # independently generated
