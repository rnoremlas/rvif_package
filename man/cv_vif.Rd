\title{
VIF and CV calculation
}
\description{
This function provides the values for the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and the Coefficient of Variation (CV) for the independent variables (excluding the intercept) in a multiple linear regression model.
}
\usage{
cv_vif(x, tol = 1e-30)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{A numerical design matrix containing more than one regressor, including the intercept in the first column.}
  \item{tol}{A real number that indicates the tolerance beyond which the system is considered computationally unique when calculating the VIF.
       The default value is \code{tol=1e-30}.}
}
\details{
It is interesting to note the distinction between essential and non-essential multicollinearity. Essential multicollinearity happens
when there is an approximate linear relationship between two or more independent variables (not including the intercept) while non-essential multicollinearity 
involves a linear relationship between the intercept and at least one independent variable. This distinction matters because the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) only detects essential multicollinearity, 
while the Condition Value (CV) is useful for detecting only non-essential multicollinearity.
Understanding the distinction between essential and non-essential multicollinearity and the limitations of each detection measure, can be very useful for identifying whether there is a troubling degree of multicollinearity, 
and determining the kind of multicollinearity present and the variables causing it.

  \item{CV}{Coefficient of Variation of each independent variable.}

\examples{
### Example 1 
### At least three independent variables, including the intercept, must be present

	head(SLM1, n=5)
	y = SLM1[,1]
	x = SLM1[,2:3]
	cv_vif(x)

### Example 2
### Creating the design matrix

	library(multiColl)
	set.seed(2025)
	obs = 100
	cte = rep(1, obs)
	x2 = rnorm(obs, 5, 0.01)
	x3 = rnorm(obs, 5, 10)
	x4 = x3 + rnorm(obs, 5, 1)
	x5 = rnorm(obs, -1, 30)
	x = cbind(cte, x2, x3, x4, x5)
	cv_vif(x)

### Example 3 
### Obtaining the design matrix after executing the command 'lm'

	library(multiColl)
	set.seed(2025)
	obs = 100
	cte = rep(1, obs)
	x2 = rnorm(obs, 5, 0.01)
	x3 = rnorm(obs, 5, 10)
	x4 = x3 + rnorm(obs, 5, 1)
	x5 = rnorm(obs, -1, 30)
	u = rnorm(obs, 0, 2)
	y = 5 + 4*x2 - 5*x3 + 2*x4 - x5 + u
	reg = lm(y~x2+x3+x4+x5)
	x = model.matrix(reg)
	cv_vif(x) # identical to Example 2

### Example 3 
### Computationally singular system

	head(soil, n=5)
	y = soil[,16]
	x = soil[,-16]
	cv_vif(x)
