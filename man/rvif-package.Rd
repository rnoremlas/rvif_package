\title{
Detecting multicollinearity using RVIF and graphical methods.
}
\description{
Detecting troubling near-multicollinearity in multiple linear regression models is a classical econometric problem. 
The purpose of this package is to detect it by using the Redefined Variance Inflation Factor 
(RVIF) and the scatterplot between the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and the Coefficient of Variation (CV).

In addition, the RVIF is used to determine whether the statistical analysis of the model is affected by the degree 
of multicollinearity in the model.
}
\details{
This package contains four functions. The first two, \code{cv_vif} and \code{plot.cv_vif}, respectively return the values of the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) 
and the Coefficient of Variation (CV), as well as their representation in a scatterplot. It should be noted that the 
VIF is useful for detecting essential multicollinearity, while the CV is useful for detecting non-essential multicollinearity.
Thus, the scatterplot of both measures can provide interesting information for determining whether there is a troubling degree 
of multicollinearity and identifying the type of multicollinearity present and the variables causing it.

On the other hand, the funcion \code{rvif} calculates the redefined VIF and the percentage of approximate multicollinearity due to each 
independent variable.

Finally, \code{multicollinearity} determines whether the degree of multicollinearity in the regression model affects the statistical 
analysis of the model, i.e., whether the non-rejection of the null hypothesis in the individual significance tests 
is due to the linear relationships between the independent variables of the model.
