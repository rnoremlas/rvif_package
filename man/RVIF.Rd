RVIF calculation
}
\description{
This function provides the values of the Redefined Variance Inflation Factor (RVIF) and the the percentage of near multicollinearity due to each independent variable.
}
\usage{
RVIF(X, l_u=TRUE, l=40, intercept=TRUE, graf=TRUE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
 \item{X}{A numerical design matrix that should contain more than one regressor.}
  \item{l_u}{A logical value that indicates if the variables in the design matrix \code{X} are transformed to unit length. By default \code{l_u=TRUE}.}
  \item{l}{A real number that indicates the lower limit of the vertical axis of the scatter plot between the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and the Coefficient of Variation (CV). By default \code{l=40}.}
  \item{intercept}{A logical value that indicates if the design matrix \code{X} have intercept. By default \code{intercept=TRUE}.}
  \item{graf}{A logical value that indicates if the scatter plot between the VIF and CV is represented by using the CV_VIF function. By default \code{graf=TRUE}.}
}
\details{
The Redefined Variation Inflation Factor (RVIF) is capable to detect both kind of multicollinearity: the essential (near-linear relationship between at least two independent variables excluding the intercept) and non-essential (near-linear relationship between the intercept and at least one of the remaining independent variables). This measure also quantifies the percentage of near multicollinearity due to each independent variable.

\value{
  \item{RVIF}{Redefined Variance Inflation Factor of each independent variable.}
  \item{\%}{Percentage of near multicollinearity due to each independent variable.}
  \item{Graph}{Scatter plot of VIF and CV.}
